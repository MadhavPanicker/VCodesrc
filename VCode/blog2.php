                <p style="color:white;">"I always felt that not learning web development had been my biggest
                    disappointment, apart from my untimely
                    death in the Endgame. Hence, I had taken up a course in VCode. I was surprised to see the experience
                    of top faculties teaching through
                    this portal. Now I feel as confident in web development as the time when I rode through space."</p>

                <p style="color: white;">"I am not *that good with technology, to be honest. I wanted to catch up with
                    the latest fad.
                    Hence, I saw this wonderful opportunity of learning web development in VCode. I was extreamly
                    pleased with the faculty's
                    expertise in the field. I passed the examination with flying colors. Now, I am a certified web
                    developer. All thanks to
                    VCode and the faculty team."</p><br>

                <p style="color: white;">My coding skills were weak. VCode helped me to develop them and now I feel

                    again!!!</p><br>
